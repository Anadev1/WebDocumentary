       <p class="story_text">My name is Ras Singh and I am the owner of a key smith business at Bazar Vest, that I run alongside my wife and our employees.<br>
       I was born and raised in India, where I grew up in a farmer family with five servants working for us in our home. Social classes are very noticeable in India, but I did not approve of the inequality that I was witnessing everyday at home. During dinner our servants would sit at a seperate table, sharing one plate and one glass. Despite my young age I did not understand why they were not allowed to sit at our table, let alone have their own plates and glasses. I was in need of change. I wanted to eat with the people of the lower class. So, I decided to move.<br><br>
       Originally I moved to West Germany, where I studied auto mechanics and worked as a waiter in a restaurant. Working as a waiter would be highly frowned upon in India, especially when you take my background into account. According to indian norms I did not belong in this field of work, but putting myself in the shoes of our servants in India taught me a lot. Although I did not experience the same inequality as they did, I did get a better understanding of what it is like to be given orders and commands continuously.

       <p class="story_text">I have always been a person that has been open towards people from all social classes, cultures and religions. I enjoy travelling to new countries and learning about their cultures and connecting with people from all walks of life.
       <br><br> Travelling to Denmark with some friends turned out to be moment that would change everything. It was during this trip, that I met my wife, who I have four children with today. It was also the country where I ultimately decided to settle down and start my own business in.<br><br>
       I have been running my key smith shop at Bazar Vest for many years at this point but it has never been about the money for me. It has always been about creating connections with people with all different kinds of backgrounds. Contrary to most marketplaces Bazar Vest is very diverse and includes businesses from all around the world. For me the most important part of my job is to make sure all my customers feel welcome at my shop - no matter their ethnicity, religion or social class.
